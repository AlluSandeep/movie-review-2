            One of the key functions of movie reviews is to assess the artistic merit and craftsmanship of a film. <br>

            techniques in conveying the intended message or eliciting emotional responses from the audience.

            understanding and appreciation of the art form.

            In addition to their evaluative role, movie reviews also serve practical purposes, such as providing recommendations tailored to different audience preferences. <br>
            Whether someone is seeking a thought-provoking drama, a pulse-pounding action thriller, or a light-hearted comedy, reviews help viewers find films <br>
            that align with their tastes and interests.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the advent of digital media and the proliferation of online platforms, movie reviews have become more accessible and diverse than ever before.<br>
